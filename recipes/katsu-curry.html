        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Katsu Curry was introduced by the Britishers to the Japanese more than a century ago. It has become a popular food in Japan served in most restaurants today.
           It combines rich curry sauce with crispy fried chicken on top of a bed of steamed white rice which gives a really nice flavour when combined together.

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>3 cups of water</li>
            <li>Curry Sauce mix</li>
            <li>Ketchup</li>
            <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
            <li>Apricot Jam</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Curry Powder</li>
            <li>Chicken Breast</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>All purpose flour and eggs</li>
            <li>Panko bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make curry sauce: Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook onions in hot oil until soft and starting to caramelize, about 8 minutes. Add potatoes and carrots. Pour in water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until potatoes are soft, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in curry sauce mix until dissolved. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, jam, and soy sauce. Simmer until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make chicken katsu: Flatten chicken breasts with a kitchen mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour onto a large plate, add beaten egg to a small plate, and place bread crumbs onto a second large plate</li>
            <li>Press chicken into flour to coat, dip in beaten egg, and press in bread crumbs to coat generously</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Carefully lower breaded cutlets into hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into a cutlet should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While chicken is cooking, stir curry powder into sauce until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Slice chicken into strips and spoon curry sauce over the top to serve.</li>     
        </ol>
